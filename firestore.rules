/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for AcademiaSpark.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student-specific data
 * while allowing public read access to learning modules. Path-based ownership
 * is used to simplify and strengthen security.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles. 'studentId' MUST match the
 *   Firebase Auth UID for ownership.
 * - /students/{studentId}/forumPosts/{forumPostId}: Forum posts by a student.
 * - /learningModules/{learningModuleId}: Publicly accessible learning modules.
 * - /students/{studentId}/moduleInteractions/{moduleInteractionId}: Student
 *   interactions with modules.
 * - /students/{studentId}/engagementInterventions/{engagementInterventionId}:
 *   Personalized intervention suggestions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only access their own profile data and related subcollections.
 * - Learning modules are publicly readable but not writable by clients.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to facilitate rapid prototyping, focusing on
 *   ownership and relational integrity checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Path-based ownership is used throughout to avoid 'get()' calls in rules.
